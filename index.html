        <p>
          I am a Salesforce Developer with a BSc in Mathematical Statistics with Finance.
          Currently, working at BlueSky Digital Solutions as a mid-level Salesforce Developer. My
          primary responsibility is to develop and customize Salesforce, a cloud-based Customer
          Relationship Management (CRM) platform, to meet the specific needs of businesses. I have
          expertise in utilizing Salesforce tools such as Apex code and Lightning components
          to build custom applications and automate processes. I have also worked on integrating
          Salesforce with other systems and have hands-on experience in troubleshooting technical
          issues and supporting ongoing maintenance and improvement of the platform.
